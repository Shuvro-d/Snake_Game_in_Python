# Snake_Game_in_Python
This is a simple game I made for assignment in code in place course of Stanford University. Here a blue box represent the snake which can be moved using the arrow keys in keyboard and the red box represent the goal, which the snake eats and finally the black box is obstacle if the snake touches the black box or collide in the wall the game is over.
