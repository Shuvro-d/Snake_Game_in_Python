# Snake_Game_in_Python
This is a simple game I made for assignment in code in place course of Stanford University. Here a blue box represent the snake which can be moved using the arrow keys in keyboard and the red box represent the goal, which the snake eats and finally the black box is obstacle if the snake touches the black box or collide in the wall the game is over. NOw there is 5 levels and you start at level 1. To go to the next level you have to score 50. At the last level you play until you die. During the game green balls appear which are extra life. By eating extra life you can avoid dying even after colliding with wall or obstacle. The library used here is for custom ide of stanford code in place course.
